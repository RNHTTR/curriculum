### Introduction
  This course is all about teaching you **Python**, one of the world's most popular (and fastest growing) programming languages. A task that takes dozens of lines of code to accomplish in Java or a hundred in C could take just a few in Python.

Python, Ruby, and several other scripting languages are quite similar, and, in some ways resemble Romance languages: once you've learned one, it's not terribly hard to pick up the other because they tend to follow many of the same conventions. Python has been demonstrated to be incredibly useful across many lines of software development:

* [Machine learning](https://www.codecademy.com/resources/blog/machine-learning-programming-languages/)
* [Prototyping](https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1224182478501482497?lang=en)
* And much more!

### The Path Ahead
Python is a big language with lots of syntax, so we've broken the concepts up into smaller chunks to make it more digestible. Some of the early material will be fairly straightforward and will rely on simple exercises to help reinforce your understanding. As you progress through the course, the goal is for you to get a much deeper and more practical understanding of the material. As you move into some of the more advanced topics, you'll be reading less and building more--just the way it should be!

* In the first section, you'll learn all about the basics of Python along with some classic programming basics.
* In the second section, you'll learn about object-oriented programming, which will show you how to cleanly and neatly organize your code into reusable objects.
* In the third section, you'll dive into some basic computer science, where you'll learn about algorithms like recursion and common data structures that will help you write efficient code.
* In the fourth section, you'll learn the basics of test-driven development.
* In the fifth section, you'll learn some more advanced features of Git and the Git workflow used by professional developers.
* In the sixth and final section, you'll tie everything together by building a fully fledged chess game.

### Optional Python Materials
The resources listed below cover Python basics, and you may want to go through these on the side while going through the first section of this Python Basics course. Repetition is the mother of all learning after all!

Consider the resources here optional, though we recommend them to help supplement your learning.

1. [The Codecademy Python course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-python) covers Python basics and OOP basics.
2. [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/)
3. TODO: More

### Okay, enough talk. Let's learn Python!
